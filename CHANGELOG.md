# Changelog

All notable changes to FreePlots are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The Help menu has a *Check for updates* item that opens the latest release
  page in the browser; the application itself still makes no network calls.
- The worksheet header has two lines per column: the automatic `C1` name stays
  on top and the user name (the one reports and graphs use) appears below.
  The lower line edits in place (double-click or type; Enter commits, Esc
  cancels), and a table pasted on it uses its first row as the column names
  and the remaining rows as data.

### Changed

- Release downloads are one `.zip` per platform: Windows x86_64 and
  Raspberry Pi 4 (aarch64). Each archive carries the executable, the licence
  inventory, the third-party notices, the SPDX SBOM and a short README, and
  `SHA256SUMS` covers the archives.
- Linux x86_64 is no longer published.
- The million-row performance gate now covers descriptive statistics,
  capability (plain and Box–Cox), I–MR, X̄–R, regression (one and two
  predictors), logistic regression, ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, PCA, K-means, moving
  average, time-series decomposition and smoothing, scatterplot, the one- and
  two-sample and paired t tests, one-sample equivalence, histogram, boxplot,
  probability plot, ECDF, correlation and its matrix, partial correlation,
  normality, run charts, Kaplan–Meier, tolerance intervals, Mann–Whitney,
  Wilcoxon, Kruskal–Wallis, Friedman, Mood's median, the sign test, Levene,
  Bartlett, the chi-square test of independence, Grubbs, a curve fit, the
  interval plot, dotplot, matrix plot, series plot, Hotelling T², acceptance
  sampling and the exponential and Weibull reliability fits, plus a
  one-million-row CSV import.
- A second gate measures the analyses dominated by an iterative fit
  (distribution comparison, Box–Cox transformation, stepwise regression,
  ordinal and Poisson regression, accelerated life) at a hundred thousand rows
  with its own budget, and the worksheet frame and the cell edit are budgeted
  with a million rows as well as a hundred thousand.

### Fixed

- Formula and workbook readers now refuse hostile inputs instead of exhausting
  memory or the stack: nested expressions are depth-limited, huge ranges are
  clamped to the worksheet, oversized cell references are rejected and a
  decompressed workbook entry cannot exceed its declared size.
- Engine errors no longer carry the misleading "unsupported option:" prefix;
  the message states the actual cause, such as a division by zero or a missing
  column.
- The correlation analysis no longer stalls on large worksheets: Kendall's
  tau-b now counts its pairs in `O(n log n)` instead of comparing every pair.
- The Wilcoxon signed-rank report no longer builds every Walsh average on a
  large sample: past 4 000 000 pairs the median interval is omitted with an
  explanatory note instead of exhausting memory.
- The centred moving average slides its window instead of re-summing it, so
  the cost is linear in the series length and no longer grows with the window.
- The correlation matrix refuses more than 40 000 000 pair-observations
  (column pairs × rows) with a message asking for fewer columns, instead of
  holding the worker for minutes on a wide selection.
- A project whose missing-value mask or column lengths do not match is now
  refused when it is read, instead of loading a table that could panic when a
  cell was displayed.
- A workbook that claims millions of padded cells (a cell in the last Excel
  column on many rows) is refused once the five-million-cell budget is
  exceeded, instead of allocating until the process is killed.
- The Kaplan–Meier fit no longer rescans the sample for every event time: the
  at-risk count advances with the sorted observations, so a million distinct
  times take linear time after the sort.
- Box-Cox capability now says that the specification limits must be positive,
  instead of reporting a non-positive observation when a limit is zero.
- Holt–Winters smoothing uses a coarser grid search above 100 000
  observations, so a million-row series no longer spends ten seconds choosing
  the constants; the report states it.
- Very large plots are thinned to a bounded sample (one in every k
  observations) and the report says so: the scatterplot, dotplot, time-series,
  probability and empirical-CDF plots, matrix panels, run chart and control
  charts no longer carry a point for every one of a million observations, and
  the time-series and survival tables list at most 500 rows. The statistics
  still use every observation.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-08

### Added

- One archive per platform (Windows x86_64 and Raspberry Pi 4, aarch64), with
  the licence inventory, third-party notices and SPDX SBOM inside.
- An unsigned Windows executable and a `SHA256SUMS` file in every release.
- Expected-PPM confidence intervals for the normal capability report (overall
  and within sigma), and the reference-corpus provenance report.

### Notes

- The Windows executable is unsigned for now: SmartScreen may warn on a
  downloaded copy. Verify the SHA-256 against `SHA256SUMS` in the release before
  running it.

### Fixed

- Closing the window with unsaved changes now asks before discarding them and
  writes a recovery copy in `FreePlots-data`.
- The formula bar exposes the accessible name "Formula bar" to screen readers.
- The Taguchi level calculation names its XOR variable correctly.
